<p class="p0"><span class="hidden">A</span>LTHOUGH excellent pickles can be bought on the market at
all seasons of the year, many housewives prefer to make their
own, particularly when their home gardens afford a plentiful supply
of cucumbers.</p>

<p>Brining is a good way to save surplus cucumbers that can not be
used or readily sold in the fresh state. Instead of letting them go
to waste it is very easy to cure them, after which they may be held
as long as desired or until they can be sold to advantage, either in
local markets or to pickle manufacturers. Thus growers are protected
against loss by overproduction or from inability to speedily
market a perishable crop, and the pickle market receives the benefit
of a steady supply.</p>


<p class="caption2">HOW BRINING PRESERVES VEGETABLES</p>

<p>When vegetables are placed in brine the juices and soluble material
contained in them are drawn out by the force known as osmosis.</p>

<p>The fermentable sugar present in all fruits and vegetables, which
is one of the soluble substances extracted by osmotic action, serves
as food for the lactic-acid bacteria which break it down into lactic
acid and certain volatile acids. In some vegetables, like cucumbers
and cabbage, where the supply of sugar is ample and other conditions
are favorable to the growth of the lactic bacteria, a decided
acid formation takes place, constituting a distinct fermentation. The
acid brine thus formed acts upon the vegetable tissues, bringing about
the changes in color, taste, and texture which mark the pickled
state.</p>

<p>As a rule, a solution of salt is used, although some vegetables
quickly give up enough moisture to convert dry salt into brine.
Salt also hardens or makes firm the vegetables placed in brine and
checks the action of organisms which might otherwise destroy the
plant tissues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span></p>

<p>Cabbage is well preserved in its own brine in the form of sauerkraut.
Other vegetables and some fruits may, under certain conditions,
be economically preserved by brining. As a rule, however,
canning is preferable for these products, because food values and
natural flavors are better preserved by that method. Lack of time,
a shortage of cans, or an oversupply of raw material may justify
the preservation of vegetables other than cucumbers and cabbage
by curing in brine.</p>


<p class="caption2">EQUIPMENT FOR BRINING AND PICKLING</p>

<p>Stone jars are the most convenient and desirable receptacles (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>)
for making small quantities of pickles. Stoneware is much more
easily kept clean and absorbs objectionable odors and flavors to a
smaller extent than wood. Straight-side, open-top jars, which come
in practically all sizes, from 1 to 20 gallons, are best for this purpose.
Those used for the directions given in this bulletin are 4-gallon
jars which hold about 12 pounds (one-fourth bushel) of cucumbers.
If only very small quantities of pickles are put up, wide-mouth bottles
or glass jars will do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<a id="fig1" name="fig1"></a>
<img src="images3/fig1.png" width="448" height="190" alt="" />
<div class="caption4"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Some suitable containers for home-brined products</div>
</div>

<p>Water-tight kegs or barrels are best for making larger quantities
of pickles. Those used for the directions given in this bulletin are
barrels holding from 40 to 45 gallons. They must first be washed,
or possibly charred, to remove all undesirable odors and flavors.
Undesirable flavors may be removed by using solutions of potash
or soda lye. A strong solution of lye should remain in the barrel
for several clays, after which the barrel should be thoroughly soaked
and washed with hot water until the lye is removed.</p>

<p>Boards about an inch thick make the best covers. These may be
of any kind of wood, except yellow or pitch pine, which would give
the pickles an undesirable flavor. They should be from 1 to 2 inches
less in diameter than the inside of the jar or barrel, so that they
may be easily removed. Dipping the covers in paraffin and then
burning them over with a flame fills the pores of the wood, thus
making it comparatively easy to keep them clean. Heavy plates
of suitable size may be used instead of boards as covers for small
containers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span></p>

<p>A clean white cloth is often needed to cover the material in the
jar or barrel. Two or three thicknesses of cheesecloth or muslin,
cut in circular form, and about 6 inches larger in diameter than the
inside of the receptacle, makes a suitable covering. Sometimes grape,
beet, or cabbage leaves are used for this purpose. Grape leaves
are a good covering for dill pickles, and cabbage leaves for sauerkraut.</p>


<p>In addition to the jars, crocks, or kegs in which the pickles are
made, 2-quart glass jars are needed for packing the finished product.
If corks are used for sealing such containers, they
should first be dipped in hot paraffin.</p>

<p>When vegetables which have been fermented in
a weak brine are to be kept for any length of time,
air must be excluded from them. This may be done
by sealing the containers with paraffin, beeswax,
or oil. Paraffin, the cheapest and probably the best
of these three substances, is easily handled and readily
separated from the pickles when they are removed
from the containers. To remove any dirt,
the paraffin should be heated and strained through
several thicknesses of cheesecloth. Thus the paraffin
may be used over and over again. The clean
paraffin is melted and poured over the surface of the
pickles in quantities sufficient to make, when hardened,
a solid coating about half an inch thick.
Where there are vermin, lids should be placed over
the paraffin in jars and other covers should be
placed over the paraffin in kegs. If applied before
active fermentation has stopped, the seal may be
broken by the formation of gas below the layer,
making it necessary to remove the paraffin, heat it
again, and once more pour it over the surface.</p>

<p>In many cases a safer and better plan for preserving
vegetables fermented in a weak brine is to
transfer the pickled product to glass jars as soon as
fermentation is completed and seal tightly.</p>

<p>Almost anything which furnishes the required
pressure will serve as a weight to hold the mass
down in a jar or keg. Clean stones (except limestone)
and bricks are recommended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 101px;">
<a id="fig2" name="fig2"></a>
<img src="images3/fig2.png" width="101" height="424" alt="" />
<div class="caption4"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;2.</span>&mdash;Salinometer</div>
</div>

<p>A pair of kitchen scales and suitable vessels for determining liquid
measure are, of course, essential.</p>

<p>The salinometer, an instrument for measuring the salt strength of
a brine, is very useful, although not absolutely necessary, in brining
(<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). By following the directions given here it will be possible
to make brines of the required strength without the use of this instrument.
Results may be readily checked, however, and any changes in
brine strength which occur from time to time may be detected by the
use of the salinometer.</p>

<p>The salinometer scale is graduated into 100 degrees, which indicate
the range of salt concentration between 0°, the reading for pure
water at 60° F,; and 100°, which indicates a saturated salt solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
(26½ per cent). Table 1 (<a href="#Table_1">page 14</a>) shows the relation between salinometer
readings and salt percentages.</p>

<p>Salinometers are sold for about $1 each by firms dealing in chemical
apparatus and supplies.</p>

<p>A sugar hydrometer is very useful in all canning and pickling
work. Either the Brix or Balling scale may be used. Both read
directly in percentages of sugar in a pure sugar solution. A Balling
hydrometer, graduated from 0° to 70°, is a convenient instrument for
the tests indicated in this bulletin.</p>


<p class="caption2">SUPPLIES FOR BRINING AND PICKLING</p>

<p class="caption3">SALT</p>

<p>Fine table salt is not necessary. What is known as common fine
salt, or even coarser grades, may be used. Caked or lumpy salt can
not be equally distributed. Salt to which anything has been added
to prevent caking is not recommended for pickling and brining.
Alkaline impurities in the salt are especially objectionable. Any
noncaking salt which contains less than 1 per cent of the carbonates
or bicarbonates of sodium, calcium, or magnesium may be used for
this purpose.</p>

<p class="caption3">VINEGAR</p>

<p>A good, clear vinegar of 40 to 60 grain strength (4 to 6 per cent
acetic acid) is required in making sour, sweet, and mixed pickles, and
is sometimes used for dill pickles. Many pickle manufacturers prefer
distilled vinegar, as it is colorless and free from sediment. If
fruit vinegars are used they should first be filtered to remove all
sediment.</p>

<p class="caption3">SUGAR</p>

<p>Granulated sugar should be used in making sweet pickles. The
quantity of sugar required for each gallon of vinegar in making
sweet liquors is shown in Table 3 (<a href="#Table_3">p. 15</a>).</p>

<p class="caption3">SPICES</p>

<p>Spices are used to some extent in making nearly all kinds of
pickles, but chiefly for sweet, mixed, and dill pickles. Various combinations
are used, depending on the kind of pickles to be made and
the flavor desired.</p>

<p>Peppers (black and cayenne), cloves, cinnamon, celery seed, caraway,
dill herb, mustard (yellow), allspice, cardamom, bay leaves,
coriander, turmeric, and mace, are the principal whole spices for this
purpose. Ginger and horse-radish root are used sometimes. All of
these spices may be purchased in bulk and mixed as desired. Mixed
whole spices, specially prepared for pickling purposes, sold in the
stores, are, as a rule, satisfactory. Care should be taken to see that
they are of proper strength.</p>

<p>Oil spices may be desirable under some circumstances, but their
effect is not so lasting as that of the whole spices.</p>

<p>Turmeric has been much used in both the commercial and household
preparation of pickles. While some of its qualities entitle it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
to be classed among the spices, it does not rank in importance as such
with the others named. It is employed largely because of its supposed
effect on the color of pickles, which is probably overestimated.</p>

<p>Dill herb is practically always used with cucumbers when they are
fermented in a weak brine and often with other vegetables fermented
in this way. It gives the pickle a distinct flavor which is very popular.
The dill herb, a native of southern Europe, can be grown in
nearly all parts of the United States and usually is obtainable in the
markets of the larger cities. While the entire stalk of the dill herb
is of value for flavoring, the seeds are best suited for imparting the
desired flavor. For this reason the crop should be harvested only
after the seeds have become fully mature but are not so ripe that they
fall off. The herb may be used green, dried, or brined. When green
or brined dill is used, twice as much by weight as would be required
if the dried herb were used is taken. Dill retains its flavor
for a long time when brined. To preserve it in this way it should
be packed in a 60° brine, or in an 80° brine if it is to be kept for a
long time. Dill brine is as good as the herb for flavoring.</p>


<p class="caption2">CUCUMBER PICKLES</p>

<p>Because of their shape, firmness, or keeping quality some varieties
of cucumbers are better adapted for making pickles than others.
Among the best of the pickling varieties are the Chicago Pickling,
Boston Pickling, and Snow's Perfection. Cucumbers of practically
all varieties, sizes, and shapes, however, make good pickles.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Information on the cultivation of cucumbers, and the diseases and enemies which
attack them, may be obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture.</p></div>

<p>Cucumbers to be pickled should retain from one-eighth to one-fourth
inch of their stems, and they should not be bruised. If dirty
they should be washed before brining. They should be placed in
brine not later than 24 hours after they have been gathered.</p>

<p>Cucumbers contain approximately 90 per cent of water. As this
large water content reduces materially the salt concentration of any
brine in which they are fermented, it is necessary to add an excess of
salt at the beginning of a fermentation in the proportion of 1 pound
for every 10 pounds of cucumbers.</p>

<p>The active stage of cucumber fermentation continues for 10 to 30
days, depending largely on the temperature at which it is conducted.
The most favorable temperature is 86° F.</p>

<p>Practically all the sugar withdrawn from the cucumbers is utilized
during the stage of active fermentation, at the end of which the brine
reaches its highest degree of acidity. During this period the salt concentration
should not be materially increased: for, although the lactic
bacteria are fairly tolerant of salt, there is a limit to their tolerance.
The addition of a large quantity of salt at this time would reduce
their acid-forming power just when this is essential to a successful
fermentation. Salt, therefore, should be added gradually over a
period of weeks.</p>

<p class="caption3">SALT PICKLES</p>

<p>Salt pickles, or salt stock, are made by curing cucumbers in a brine
which should contain not less than 9.5 per cent of salt (approximately
36° on the salinometer scale) at the start. Not only must the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
brine be kept at this strength, but salt should be added until it has a
concentration of about 15 per cent (60° on the salinometer scale).
If well covered with a brine of this strength, the surface of which
is kept clean, pickles will keep indefinitely.</p>

<p>Proper curing of cucumbers requires from six weeks to two months,
or possibly longer, according to the temperature at which the process
is carried out and the size and variety of the cucumbers. Attempts
to use short cuts or to make pickles overnight, as is sometimes advised,
are based on a mistaken idea of what really constitutes a pickle.</p>

<p>Curing of cucumbers is marked by an increased firmness, a greater
degree of translucency, and a change in color from pale green to
dark or olive green. These changes are uniform throughout the perfectly
cured specimen. So long as any portion of a pickle is whitish
or opaque it is not perfectly cured.</p>

<p>After proper processing in water, salt pickles may be eaten as such
or they may be converted into sour pickles (<a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>), sweet pickles
(<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>), or mixed pickles (<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>).</p>

<p class="caption3">SMALL QUANTITIES</p>

<p>Pack the cucumbers in a 4-gallon jar and cover with 6 quarts of a
10 per cent brine (40° on salinometer scale). At the time of making
up the brine, or not later than the following day, add more salt at
the rate of 1 pound for every 10 pounds of cucumbers used&mdash;in this
case 1 pound and 3 ounces. This is necessary to maintain the strength
of the brine.</p>

<p>Cover with a round board or plate that will go inside the jar, and
on top of this place a weight heavy enough to keep the cucumbers
well below the surface of the brine.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week, and at the end of each succeeding
week for five weeks, add one-fourth pound of salt. In adding salt
always place it on the cover. If it is added directly to the brine, it
may sink, as a result of which the salt solution at the bottom will be
very strong, while that near the surface may be so weak that the
pickles will spoil.</p>

<p>A scum, made up usually of wild yeasts and molds, forms on the
surface. As this may prove injurious by destroying the acidity of
the brine, remove it by skimming.</p>

<p class="caption3">LARGE QUANTITIES</p>

<p>Put into a barrel 5 to 6 inches of a 40° brine (<a href="#Table_1">Table 1, p. 14</a>)
and add 1 quart of good vinegar. In this brine place the cucumbers
as they are gathered. Weigh the cucumbers each time before they
are added. Put a loose-fitting wooden cover over the cucumbers
and weight it down with a stone heavy enough to bring the brine
over the cover. After the cover and stone have been replaced add to
the brine over the cover 1 pound of salt for every 10 pounds of
cucumbers.</p>

<p>Unless the cucumbers are added too rapidly, it will be unnecessary
to add more brine, for when a sufficient weight is maintained on the
cover the cucumbers make their own brine. If, however, the cucumbers
are added rapidly, or if the barrel is filled at once, more brine
may be required. In such a case, add enough of the 40° brine to
cover the cucumbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span></p>

<p>When the barrel is full, add 3 pounds of salt each week for five
weeks (15 pounds to a 45-gallon barrel). In adding the salt, place it
on the cover. Added in this way it goes into solution slowly, insuring
a brine of uniform strength throughout and a gradually increasing
salt concentration. Thus, shriveling of the pickles is prevented
to a great extent and the growth and activity of the lactic bacteria
are not seriously checked.</p>

<p>Stirring or agitation of the brine may be harmful for the reason
that the introduction of air bubbles is conducive to the growth of
spoilage bacteria.</p>

<p>From time to time remove the scum which forms on the surface.</p>

<p>Where cucumbers are grown extensively for the production of
pickles, curing is done in large tanks at salting stations. While it
involves certain details of procedure not required in barrel quantities,
this method of curing is essentially the same.</p>

<p class="caption3">PROCESSING</p>

<p>After being cured in brine, pickles must receive a processing in
water to remove the excess of salt. If they are to be used as salt
pickles, only a partial processing is required. If, however, they are
to be made into sour, sweet, or mixed pickles, the salt should be
largely, but not completely, removed. Pickles keep better when the
salt is not entirely soaked out.</p>

<p>Under factory conditions, processing is accomplished by placing
the pickles in tanks, which are then filled with water and subjected
to a current of steam, the pickles being agitated meanwhile. In most
homes, however, the equipment for such treatment is not available.</p>

<p>The best that can be done in the home is to place the pickles in a
suitable vessel, cover them with water, and heat them slowly to about
120° F., at which temperature they should be held for from 10 to 12
hours, being stirred frequently. The water is then poured off, and
the process is repeated, if necessary, until the pickles have only a
slightly salty taste.</p>

<p class="caption3">SORTING</p>

<p>After processing, the pickles should be sorted. To secure the most
attractive product, pickles should be as nearly as possible of uniform
size. At least three sizes are recognized&mdash;small (2 to 3 inches long) ,
medium (3 to 4 inches long), and large (4 inches or longer). Only
the small sizes are selected for bottling. Fairly small and medium-large
cucumbers are well adapted to the making of sweet pickles.
The larger sizes may be used for sour and dill pickles. Imperfectly
formed pickles, the so-called crooks and nubs, can be cut up and
added to mixed pickles or other combinations of which cucumbers
form a part. The number of pickles of various sizes required to
make a gallon is shown in <a href="#Table_4">Table 4, page 16</a>.</p>

<p class="caption3">SOUR PICKLES</p>

<p>After pickles have been processed sufficiently, drain them well and
cover them at once with vinegar. A 45 or 50 grain vinegar usually
gives all the sourness that is desirable. If, however, very sour pickles
are preferred, it would be well to use at first a 45-grain vinegar, and
after a week or 10 days transfer the pickles to a vinegar of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
strength desired. As the first vinegar used will in all cases be greatly
reduced in strength by dilution with the brine contained in the
pickles, it will be necessary to renew the vinegar after a few weeks.
If this is not done and the pickles are held for any length of time
they may spoil.</p>

<p>The best containers for sour pickles are stone jars, or, for large
quantities, kegs or barrels. Covered with a vinegar of the proper
strength, pickles should keep indefinitely.</p>

<p class="caption3">SWEET PICKLES</p>

<p>Cover the cured and processed cucumbers with a sweet liquor
made by dissolving sugar in vinegar, usually with the addition of
spices. Depending upon the degree of sweetness desired, the quantity
of sugar may vary from 4 to 10 pounds to the gallon of vinegar,
6 pounds to the gallon usually giving satisfactory results. The chief
difficulty in making sweet pickles is their tendency to become shriveled
and tough, which increases with the sugar concentration of the
liquor. This danger can usually be avoided by covering the pickles
first with a plain 45 to 50 grain vinegar. After one week discard
this vinegar, which in all probability has become greatly reduced in
strength, and cover with a liquor made by adding 4 pounds of sugar
to the gallon of vinegar. It is very important that the acidity of
the liquor used on pickles be kept as high as possible. A decrease
in acidity much below a 30-grain strength may permit the growth of
yeasts, with resulting fermentation and spoilage.</p>

<p>If a liquor containing more than 4 pounds of sugar to the gallon
is desired, it would be best not to .exceed that quantity at first, but
gradually add sugar until the desired concentration is obtained. A
sugar hydrometer readily and accurately indicates the sugar concentration
(<a href="#Page_4">p. 4</a>). A reading of 42° (Brix or Balling) would indicate
a concentration of approximately 6 pounds of sugar to the
gallon of vinegar. (<a href="#Table_3">Table 3, p. 15</a>.)</p>

<p>Spices are practically always added in making sweet pickles. The
effect of too much spice, especially the stronger kinds, like peppers
and cloves, however, is injurious. One ounce of whole mixed spices to
4 gallons of pickles is enough. As spices may cause cloudiness of the
vinegar, they should be removed after the desired flavor has been
obtained. Heating is an aid to a better utilization of the spice. Add
the required quantity of spice, in a cheesecloth bag, to the vinegar
and hold at the boiling point for not longer than half an hour. Heating
too long causes the vinegar to darken. If considered desirable,
add sugar at this time, and pour at once over the pickles.</p>

<p>If the pickles are to be packed in bottles or jars, after such preliminary
treatment as may be required, transfer them to these containers
and cover them with a liquor made as desired.</p>

<p class="caption3">DILL PICKLES</p>

<p>The method for making dill pickles differs from that for making
salt pickles in two important particulars. A much weaker brine is
used, and spices, chiefly dill, are added.</p>

<p>Because of the weaker salt concentration, a much more rapid curing
takes place. As a result they can be made ready for use in about
half the time required for ordinary brined pickles. This shortening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
of the period of preparation, however, is gained at the expense of
the keeping quality of the product. For this reason it is necessary
to resort to measures which will prevent spoilage.</p>

<p class="caption3">SMALL QUANTITIES</p>

<p>Place in the bottom of the jar a layer of dill and one-half ounce of
mixed spice. Then fill the jar, to within 2 or 3 inches of the top,
with washed cucumbers of as nearly the same size as practicable.
Add another half ounce of spice and layer of dill. It is a good plan
to place over the top a layer of grape leaves. In fact, it would be
well to place these at both the bottom and top. They make a very
suitable covering and have a greening effect on the pickles.</p>

<p>Pour over the pickles a brine made as follows: Salt, 1 pound;
vinegar, 1 pint ; water, 2 gallons. Never use a hot brine at the beginning
of a fermentation. The chances are that it would kill the organisms
present, thus preventing fermentation.</p>

<p>Cover with a board cover or plate with sufficient weight on top to
hold the cucumbers well below the brine.</p>

<p>If the cucumbers are packed at a temperature around 86° F., an
active fermentation will at once set in. This should be completed
in 10 days to 2 weeks, if a temperature of about 86° F. is maintained.
The scum which soon forms on the surface and which consists
usually of wild yeasts, but often contains molds and bacteria, should
be skimmed off.</p>

<p>After active fermentation has stopped, it is necessary to protect
the pickles against spoilage. This may be done in one of two ways:</p>

<p>(1) Cover with a layer of paraffin. This should be poured while
hot over the surface of the brine or as much of it as is exposed around
the edges of the board cover. When cooled this forms a solid coating
which effectually seals the pickles.</p>

<p>(2) Seal the pickles in glass jars or cans. As soon as they are
sufficiently cured, which may be determined by their agreeable flavor
and dark-green color, transfer them to glass jars, and fill either with
their own brine or with a fresh brine made as directed. Add a small
quantity of dill and spice. Bring the brine to a boil, and, after
cooling to about 160° F., pour it over the pickles, filling the jars full.
Seal the jars tight.</p>

<p>The plan of preserving dill pickles by sealing in jars has the merit
of permitting the use of a small quantity without the necessity of
opening and resealing a large bulk, as is the case when pickles are
packed in large containers and sealed with paraffin.</p>

<p class="caption3">LARGE QUANTITIES</p>

<p>Fill a barrel with cucumbers. Add 6 to 8 pounds of green or
brined dill, or half that quantity of dry dill, and 1 quart of mixed
spices. If brined dill is used, it is well to add about 2 quarts of the
dill brine. The dill and spices should be evenly distributed at the
bottom, middle, and top of the barrel. Also add 1 gallon of good
vinegar.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> This addition of vinegar is not essential, and many prefer not to use it. In the
proportion indicated, however, it is favorable to the growth of the lactic bacteria and
helps to prevent the growth of spoilage organisms. Its use, therefore, is to be regarded
with favor. Some prefer to omit the mixed spices for the reason that they interfere with
the distinctive flavor of the dill herb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>Head up tight and, through a hole bored in the head, fill the barrel
with a brine made in the proportion of one-half pound of salt to
a gallon of water. Add brine until it flows over the head and is
level with the top of the chime. Maintain this level by adding brine
from time to time. Remove the scum which soon forms on the surface.</p>


<p>During the period of active fermentation, keep the barrel in a
warm place and leave the hole in the head open to allow gas to escape.
When active fermentation is over, as indicated by the cessation of
bubbling and frothing on the surface, the barrel may be plugged
tight and placed in storage, preferably in a cool place. Leakage
and other conditions may cause the brine in a barrel of pickles to
recede at any time. The barrels should be inspected occasionally, and
more brine added if necessary. Pickles put up in this way should
be ready for use within about six weeks.</p>

<p>When pickles are to be held in storage a long time, a 28° brine,
made by adding 10 ounces of salt to a gallon of water, should be used.
Pickles packed in a brine of this strength will keep a year, if the
barrels are kept filled and in a cool place. The important factor
in preserving pickles put up in a weak brine, such as is ordinarily
used for dill pickles, is the exclusion of air. When put up in tight
barrels this is accomplished by keeping the barrels entirely filled
with brine.</p>


<p class="caption2">MIXED PICKLES</p>

<p>Onions, cauliflower, green peppers, tomatoes, and beans, as well
as cucumbers, are used for making mixed pickles. All vegetables
should first be cured in brine.</p>

<p>For making mixed pickles, very small vegetables are much to be
preferred. If larger ones must be used, first cut them into pieces
of a desirable and uniform shape and size. Place in the bottom
of each wide-mouth bottle or jar a little mixed spice. In filling the
bottle arrange the various kinds of pickles in as neat and orderly
a manner as possible. The appearance of the finished product depends
largely upon the manner in which they are packed in the
bottle. Do not completely fill the bottles.</p>

<p>If sour pickles are desired, fill the bottles completely with a
45-grain vinegar. If sweet ones are wanted, fill with a liquor made
by dissolving 4 to 6 pounds of sugar in a gallon of vinegar.</p>

<p>Seal tight, and label properly.</p>


<p class="caption3">SAUERKRAUT</p>

<p>For making sauerkraut in the home, 4 or 6 gallon stone jars are
considered the best containers, unless large quantities are desired, in
which case kegs or barrels may be used.</p>

<p>Select only mature, sound heads of cabbage. After removing all
decayed or dirty leaves, quarter the heads and slice off the core
portion. For shredding, one of the hand-shredding machines which
can be obtained on the market is much the best, although an ordinary
slaw cutter or a large knife will do.</p>

<p>In making sauerkraut the fermentation is carried out in a brine
made from the juice of the cabbage which is drawn out by the salt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
One pound of salt for every 40 pounds of cabbage makes the proper
strength of brine to produce the best results. The salt may be
distributed as the cabbage is packed in the jar or it may be mixed
with the shredded cabbage before being packed. The distribution
of 2 ounces of salt with every 5 pounds of cabbage probably is the
best way to get an even distribution.</p>

<p>Pack the cabbage firmly, but not too tightly, in the jar or keg.
When full, cover with a clean cloth and a board or plate. On the
cover place a weight heavy enough to cause the brine to come up to
the cover.</p>

<p>If the jar is kept at a temperature of about 86° F., fermentation
will start promptly. A scum soon forms on the surface of the brine.
As this scum tends to destroy the acidity and may affect the cabbage,
it should be skimmed off from time to time.</p>

<p>If kept at 86° F., the fermentation should be completed in six
to eight days.</p>

<p>A well-fermented sauerkraut should show a normal acidity of
approximately +20, or a lactic acid percentage of 1.8 (<a href="#Page_16">p. 16</a>).</p>

<p>After fermentation is complete, set the sauerkraut in a cool place.
If the cabbage is fermented late in the fall, or if it can be stored
in a very cool place, it may not be necessary to do more than keep
the surface skimmed and protected from insects, etc.; otherwise it
will be necessary to resort to one of the following measures to prevent
spoilage:</p>

<p>(1) Pour a layer of hot paraffin over the surface, or as much of
it as is exposed around the cover. Properly applied to a clean
surface, this effectually seals the jar and protects the contents from
contamination.</p>

<p>(2) After the fermentation is complete, pack the sauerkraut in
glass jars, adding enough of the "kraut" brine, or a weak brine
made by adding an ounce of salt to a quart of water, to completely
fill the jars. Seal the jars tight, and set them away in a cool place.</p>

<p>The second method is much to be p referred to the first. Sauerkraut
properly fermented and stored in this way has kept throughout
a season in good condition. Placing the jars before sealing in
a water bath and heating until the center of the jar shows a temperature
of about 160° F. gives an additional assurance of good-keeping
quality of the "kraut."</p>

<p>In the commercial canning of sauerkraut, where conditions and
length of storage can not be controlled, heat must always be used.</p>


<p class="caption2">FERMENTATION AND SALTING OF VEGETABLES
OTHER THAN CUCUMBERS AND CABBAGE</p>

<p>There are three methods of preserving vegetables by the use of
salt:</p>

<p class="caption3">FERMENTATION IN AN ADDED BRINE</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that string beans, green tomatoes, beets,
chayotes, mango melons, burr gherkins, cauliflower, and corn (on
cob) may be well preserved in a 10 per cent brine (40° on the salinometer
scale) for several months. Peppers and onions are better
preserved in an 80° brine. The brine must be maintained at its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
original strength by the addition of salt, and the surface of the
brine must be kept free from scum. Some of the vegetables listed,
notably string beans and green tomatoes, are well adapted to fermentation
in a weak brine (5 per cent salt), in which case dill and
other spices may be added. The general directions given for dill
pickles (<a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>) should be followed.</p>

<p class="caption3">FERMENTATION IN BRINE PRODUCED BY DRY SALTING</p>

<p>This method, of course, can be used only for vegetables which
contain enough water to make their own brine. String beans, if
young and tender, may be preserved in this way. Remove tips and
strings, and, if the pods are large, break them in two. Older beans,
and doubtless other vegetables, could be preserved by this method
if first shredded in the same manner as cabbage (<a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>). Use salt
equal to 3 per cent of the weight of the vegetables (1 ounce salt
to about 2 pounds vegetables).</p>

<p class="caption3">SALTING WITHOUT FERMENTATION</p>

<p>Enough salt to prevent all bacterial action must be added. Wash
and weigh the vegetables. Mix with them thoroughly one-fourth
their weight of salt. If after the addition of pressure there is not
enough brine to cover the product, add brine made by dissolving
1 pound of salt in 2 quarts of water. As soon as bubbling ceases,
protect the surface by covering with paraffin. This method is especially
well adapted to vegetables in which the sugar content is too
low to produce a successful fermentation, such as chard, spinach,
and dandelions. Corn can also be well preserved in this way. Husk
it and remove the silk. Cook it in boiling water for 10 minutes,
to set the milk. Then cut the corn from the cob with a sharp knife,
weigh it, and pack it in layers, with one-fourth its weight of fine
salt.</p>

<p>The methods of preservation outlined are not limited to vegetables.
Solid fruits, like clingstone peaches and Kieffer pears, can be preserved
in an 80° brine for as long as six months. After the salt has
been soaked out, they may be worked up into desirable products by
the use of spices, vinegar, sugar, etc. Soft fruits, like Elberta
peaches and Bartlett pears, are best preserved in weak vinegar (2
per cent acetic acid).<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Report of an investigation in the Bureau of Chemistry on the utilization of brined
products, by Rhea C. Scott, 1919.</p></div>


<p class="caption2">CAUSES OF FAILURE</p>

<p class="caption3">SOFT OR SLIPPERY PICKLES</p>

<p>A soft or slippery condition, one of the most common forms of
spoilage in making pickles, is the result of bacterial action. It
always occurs when pickles are exposed above the brine and very
often when the brine is too weak to prevent the growth of spoilage
organisms. To prevent it keep the pickles well below the brine and
the brine at the proper strength. To keep pickles for more than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
very few weeks a brine should contain 10 per cent of salt. Once
pickles have become soft or slippery as a result of bacterial action
no treatment will restore them to a normal condition.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOLLOW PICKLES</p>

<p>Hollow pickles may occur during the process of curing. This
condition, however, does not mean a total loss, for hollow pickles
may be utilized in making mixed pickles or certain forms of relish.
While there are good reasons to believe that hollow pickles are
the result of a faulty development or nutrition of the cucumber,
there is also a strong probability that incorrect methods may contribute
to their formation. One of these is allowing too long a
time to intervene between gathering and brining. This period
should not exceed 21 hours.</p>

<p>Hollow pickles frequently become floaters. Sound cucumbers
properly cured do not float, but any condition which operates to
lower their relative weight, such as gaseous distention, may cause
them to rise to the surface.</p>

<p class="caption3">EFFECT OF HARD WATER</p>

<p>So-called hard waters should not be used in making a brine. The
presence of large quantities of calcium salts and possibly other
salts found in many natural waters may prevent the proper acid
formation, thus interfering with normal curing. The addition of
a small quantity of vinegar serves to overcome alkalinity when
hard water must be used. If present in any appreciable quantity,
iron is objectionable, causing a blackening of the pickles under
some conditions.</p>

<p class="caption3">SHRIVELING</p>

<p>Shriveling of pickles often occurs when they have been placed
at once in very strong salt or sugar solutions, or even in very strong
vinegars. For this reason avoid such solutions so far as possible.
When a strong solution is desirable the pickles should first be given
a preliminary treatment in a weaker solution. This difficulty is
most often encountered in making sweet pickles. The presence of
sugar in high concentrations is certain to cause shriveling unless</p>

<p class="caption3">EFFECT OF TOO MUCH SALT ON SAUERKRAUT</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common cause of failure in making sauerkraut
is the use of too much salt. The proper quantity is 2| per cent by
weight of the cabbage packed. When cabbage is to be fermented
in very warm weather it may be well to use a little more salt. As
a rule, however, this should not exceed 3 per cent. In applying the
salt see that it is evenly distributed. The red streaks which are
sometimes seen in sauerkraut are believed to be due to uneven distribution
of salt.</p>

<p class="caption3">EFFECT OF SCUM</p>

<p>Spoilage of the top layers of vegetables fermented in brine is sure
to occur unless the scum which forms on the surface is frequently
removed. This scum is made up of wild yeasts, molds, and bacteria,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
which, if allowed to remain, attack and break down the vegetables
beneath. They may also weaken the acidity of the brine, in which
way they may cause spoilage. The fact that the top layers have
spoiled, does not necessarily mean, however, that all in the container
are spoiled. The molds and other organisms which cause the
spoilage do not quickly get down to the lower layers. The part
found in good condition often may be saved by carefully removing
the spoiled part from the top, adding a little fresh brine, and pouring
hot paraffin over the surface.</p>

<p class="caption3">EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE</p>

<p>Temperature has an important bearing on the success of a lactic
fermentation. The bacteria which are essential in the fermentation
of vegetable foods are most active at a temperature of approximately
86° F., and as the temperature falls below this point their activity
correspondingly diminishes. It is essential, therefore, that the foods
be kept as close as possible to 86° F. at the start and during the
active stages of a fermentation. This is especially important in
the production of sauerkraut, which is often made in the late fall or
winter. The fermentation may be greatly retarded or even stopped
by too low a temperature.</p>

<p>After the active stages of a fermentation have passed, store the
food in a cool place. Low temperatures are always an aid in the
preservation of food products.</p>


<p class="caption2">COLORING AND HARDENING AGENTS</p>

<p>To make what is thought to be a better looking product, it is the
practice in some households to "green" pickles by heating them with
vinegar in a copper vessel. Experiments have shown that in this
treatment copper acetate is formed, and that the pickles take up
very appreciable quantities of it. <i>Copper acetate is poisonous.</i></p>

<p>By a ruling of the Secretary of Agriculture, made July 12, 1912,
foods greened with copper salts, all of which are poisonous, will be
regarded as adulterated.</p>

<p>Alum is often used for the purpose presumably of making
pickles firm. The use of alum in connection with food products is
of doubtful expediency, to say the least. If the right methods are
followed in pickling, the salt and acids in the brine will give the
desired firmness. The use of alum, or any other hardening agent,
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The figures given in the first two columns of <a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a> are correct.
Those in the last column are correct within the possibilities of
ordinary household methods. To make up a brine from this table,
the required quantity of salt is dissolved in a smaller volume of
water and water is added to make up as nearly as possible to the
required 6 quarts.</p>

<p>One pound of salt dissolved in 9 pints of water makes a solution
with a salinometer reading of 40°, or approximately a 10 per cent
brine. In a brine of this strength, fermentation proceeds somewhat
slowly. Pickles kept in a brine maintained at this strength will not
spoil. One-half pound of salt dissolved in 9 pints of water makes
approximately a 5 per cent brine, with a salinometer reading of 20°.
A brine of this strength permits a rapid fermentation, but vegetables
kept in such a brine will spoil within a few weeks if air is not excluded.</p>


<p>A brine in which a fresh egg just floats is approximately a 10
per cent solution.</p>

<p>Fermentation takes place fairly well in brines of 40° strength, and
will, to some extent at least, up to 60°. At 80° all fermentation
stops.</p>

<p>The volume of brine necessary to cover vegetables is about half the
volume of the material to be fermented. For example, if a 5-gallon
keg is to be packed, 2½ gallons of brine is required.</p>

<p>The maximum acidity formed by a lactic fermentation of vegetables
in brine varies from 0.25 to 2 per cent. The maximum is
reached at or soon after the close of the active stage of fermentation.
After this the acidity usually decreases slowly. The stage of
active fermentation continues for from one to three weeks, depending
upon the temperature, strength of brine, etc. During this period
gas is formed and froth appears on the surface, owing to the rising
of gas bubbles. At the close of this period the brine becomes "still."</p>

<p>The quantity of acid formed depends primarily upon the sugar
content of the vegetables fermented, but it may be influenced by other
factors.</p>

<p>Dipping a piece of blue litmus paper (obtainable at drug stores)
in the brine will show whether the brine is acid. If the paper turns
pinkish or red, the brine is acid, but the litmus paper does not give a
definite indication of the degree of acidity.</p>

<p>For those who want to know accurately what the degree of acidity
is the following method is outlined:</p>

<p>With a pipette transfer exactly 5 cubic centimeters of the brine to
a small evaporating dish. To this add 45 cubic centimeters of distilled
water and 1 cubic centimeter of a 0.5 per cent solution of phenolphthalein
in 50 per cent alcohol. Then run in slowly a one-twentieth
normal sodium hydrate solution. This is best done by using
a 25 cubic centimeter burette, graduated in tenths. As the sodium
hydrate is being added stir constantly, and note carefully when the
entire liquid shows a faint pink tint. This indicates that the neutral
point has been reached. Read off carefully the exact quantity of
sodium hydrate required to neutralize the mixture in the dish. This
number multiplied by 0.09 gives the number of grams of acid per
100 cubic centimeters, calculated as lactic, present in the brine.</p>

<p>This method can be used to determine the acid strength of vinegars.
Multiply by 0.06 to ascertain the number of grams of acetic
acid per 100 cubic centimeters present in the vinegar.</p>

<p>The apparatus and chemicals needed for this test can be obtained
from any firm dealing in chemical apparatus and supplies.</p>

available at The Internet Archive.


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

 owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
 must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License.  You must require such a user to return or
 destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

 www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
